# Data Cleaning&Integration for NC water
This project, completed during my role as a Data RA at UNC's Environmental Finance Center,focusing on cleaning and integrating raw data from multiple water-related projects, including CDBG-I, Drinking Water, and Wastewater. The data spans from 2014 to 2023 and originates from over 400 Excel files, categorized by Fall and Spring seasons. Using R and various data processing techniques, the raw data was transformed into a single standardized table with 139 columns and 4,463 rows for further analysis.
